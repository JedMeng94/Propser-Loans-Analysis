The goal of this analysis was to provide descriptive stats and visualizations about the characteristics of Prosper Loans. Prosper allows people to loan money to others at a small service fee in order to charge interest on the loan. Visualizations with Tableau focus more on data changing with different filters while R focused on raw numbers.
